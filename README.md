# Python Code for the Manuscript
### Titled: 'Innovation lineage structure: A graph structure in publications of scholars and its association with disruption'  
#### Submitted to *Information Processing & Management*

This repository contains the Python code used in the analysis presented in the manuscript. Below is an overview of the contents of each folder:

## Folder Structure

### 1. `1-data extraction`
This folder contains the Python code responsible for extracting the original data used in the study. The data extraction involves collecting metadata on scholarly publications necessary for the analysis of innovation lineage structures.

### 2. `2-innovation lineage structure extraction`
This folder includes the Python scripts used for the extraction of innovation lineage structures with various configurations:
- **N=2**: Innovation lineage structure extracted with a depth of 2.
- **N=6**: Innovation lineage structure extracted with a depth of 6.
- **N=3-5**: Innovation lineage structure extracted with a depth between 3 and 5.

### 3. `3-correlation and regression`
This folder contains Python code used for conducting correlation and regression analyses. These analyses examine the association between innovation lineage structures and the level of disruption in the publications.

### 4. `4-underlying reasons`
This folder contains the code for identifying and revealing the underlying reasons for the research findings.
